# Planned Changes

```lua
-- PLANNED: consider setting the color of the UI based on directory
--  Algorithm would hash the directory path, reverse, and then create a color
--  based on the first set of six valid letters that can be converted to a hex color
-- Could also be done in WezTerm instead of nvim
```
